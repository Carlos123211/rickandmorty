This project is an SPA with no routers, it depends on the actions you do inside it, if you refresh the page it
would load from the begin. For production deployment we use command `ng build --prod`,

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
